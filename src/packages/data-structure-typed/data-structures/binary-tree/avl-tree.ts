 * 3. Rotations for Balancing: Utilizes rotations (single or double) to maintain balance after updates.
 * 4. Order Preservation: Maintains the binary search tree property where left child values are less than the parent, and right child values are greater.
 * 5. Efficient Lookups: Offers O(log n) search time, where 'n' is the number of nodes, due to its balanced nature.
 * 6. Complex Insertions and Deletions: Due to rebalancing, these operations are more complex than in a regular BST.
 * 7. Path Length: The path length from the root to any leaf is longer compared to an unbalanced BST, but shorter than a linear chain of nodes.
 * 8. Memory Overhead: Stores balance factors (or heights) at each node, leading to slightly higher memory usage compared to a regular BST.
